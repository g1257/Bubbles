Bubbles is a collection of D classes that are common to 
 codes for the simulation of strongly correlated electrons.

The reason for Bubbles is to share code among different applications.

Bubbles might replace PsimagLite if the above codes are eventually ported to the
D Programming Language.
Applications that might depend on Bubbles in the future are:
SpinPhononFermion, DMRG++, Lanczos++, FreeFermions, and GpusDoneRight.

Below is the functionality already ported or being ported.
